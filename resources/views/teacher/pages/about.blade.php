                Peer feedback is a process whereby students share their writing with their peers and in return, receive
                and
                offer formative feedback on their work. By offering remarks and observations, students begin to think
                more
                about their own work and thus gain insights on how to improve it further, in the light of feedback
                provided.
                Multiple studies have found that when students interact with each other's work, they are exposed to a
                variety of strategies and approaches to addressing and solving a problem. The ultimate aim of a
                peer-feedback process is to enable students to improve their work by receiving and offering constructive
                criticism and feedback on each otherâ€™s writing.

                Collab-learn is an innovative e-platform that offers students the opportunity to share their writing
                with
                their peers in order to receive and offer feedback on their work. It has been designed to be simple and
                easy
                to use whereby students upload their writing in a secure environment, thus making it available to others
                within their cohort to offer feedback.
            </p>

                For tutors, it offers the capability to create a unique session for each cohort. The unique session ID
                enables tutors to run multiple and simultaneous peer-feedback sessions.
